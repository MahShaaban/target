Predict Combined Function of Transcription Factors

Implement the BETA algorithm for infering direct target genes from DNA-binding
and perturbation expression data Wang et al. (2013). Extend the algorithm to 
predict the combined function of two DNA-binding elements from comprable 
binding and expression data.
